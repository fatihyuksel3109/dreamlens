**Tech Stack (Definite Choices):**

* **Frontend:** React Native (Expo managed workflow), React Navigation (for navigation), React Native Paper (for UI components), Zustand (for state management).
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB Atlas (for database), OpenAI API (GPT-4-mini for dream interpretation), Firebase Authentication.
* **Hosting:** Expo Application Services (EAS) for mobile app builds and deployments, Render for backend hosting.

**Sprint 1: Project Initialization & Core Backend Setup (Week 1)**

* **Goal:** Set up the project structure and establish the core backend functionality.

* **Tasks:**
    1. **Create GitHub Repository:** Initialize a new repository and set up basic version control.
    2. **Expo Project Setup:** Create a new Expo managed workflow project using `expo init DreamLens`.
    3. **Backend Project Setup:** Create a new Node.js/Express.js project. Install necessary dependencies (`express`, `mongoose`, `openai`, `firebase-admin`).
    4. **MongoDB Atlas Setup:** Create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and get the connection URI.
    5. **Database Connection:** Establish a connection between your backend and MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose.
    6. **Firebase Project Setup:** Create a Firebase project and enable Authentication. Get the Firebase SDK credentials.
    7. **Basic API Endpoint:** Create a simple `/api/health` endpoint in your backend that returns a 200 status code. This will be your initial test endpoint.

**Sprint 2: User Authentication (Week 2)**

* **Goal:** Implement user registration and login functionality using Firebase Authentication.

* **Tasks:**
    1. **Firebase Integration (Backend):** Integrate the Firebase Admin SDK into your backend to handle user authentication.
    2. **API Endpoints (Signup/Login):** Create `/api/auth/signup` and `/api/auth/login` endpoints in your backend.  These endpoints should handle user registration and login using Firebase.
    3. **React Native Authentication Screens:** Create basic signup and login screens in your React Native app.
    4. **Authentication Flow (Frontend):** Implement the authentication flow in your React Native app, connecting to the backend API endpoints.
    5. **Protected Routes (Frontend):** Implement basic protected routes in your React Native app using React Navigation.  Users should only be able to access certain screens after logging in.
    6. **Basic User Model:** Create a Mongoose schema for your User model in MongoDB, storing at least the user's Firebase UID.

**Sprint 3: Dream Submission & AI Interpretation (Week 3)**

* **Goal:** Implement the core functionality of submitting a dream and receiving an AI-generated interpretation.

* **Tasks:**
    1. **Dream Submission Form (Frontend):** Create a form in your React Native app where users can submit their dreams (a simple text input will do for the MVP).
    2. **`/api/dreams` Endpoint:** Create a `/api/dreams` POST endpoint in your backend. This endpoint should:
        * Receive the dream text from the frontend.
        * Call the OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo) to generate an interpretation.  Experiment with different prompts to get good results.
        * Store the dream and the interpretation in MongoDB, associated with the logged-in user.
        * Send the interpretation back to the frontend.
    3. **Display Interpretation (Frontend):** Display the AI-generated interpretation in your React Native app.
    4. **Loading State/Error Handling:** Implement loading states and error handling in your React Native app to provide a good user experience.
    5. **Postman Testing:** Thoroughly test your `/api/dreams` endpoint using Postman.

**Sprint 4: Dream History Display (Week 4)**

* **Goal:** Allow users to view their past dream interpretations.

* **Tasks:**
    1. **`/api/dreams` GET Endpoint:** Create a `/api/dreams` GET endpoint in your backend. This endpoint should retrieve the dream history for the logged-in user from MongoDB.
    2. **Dream History Screen (Frontend):** Create a screen in your React Native app to display the user's dream history.
    3. **Data Fetching (Frontend):** Implement the logic in your React Native app to fetch the dream history from the backend API.
    4. **Display Dream History (Frontend):** Display the dream history in a list format in your React Native app (React Native `FlatList` is a good choice).

**Sprint 5: UI/UX Improvements & Refinements (Week 5)**

* **Goal:** Improve the user interface and user experience of the app.

* **Tasks:**
    1. **React Native Paper Integration:** Implement React Native Paper components for styling and UI elements.
    2. **Navigation Refinement:** Improve the navigation flow and user experience using React Navigation.
    3. **Dream Interpretation Display:** Improve the way dream interpretations are displayed (formatting, readability).
    4. **Basic Styling:** Add basic styling to the app to make it visually appealing.
    5. **Testing & Bug Fixes:** Thoroughly test the app and fix any bugs that you find.

**Sprint 6: Deployment & Final Testing (Week 6)**

* **Goal:** Deploy the app and perform final testing.

* **Tasks:**
    1. **Backend Deployment (Render):** Deploy your backend to Render.
    2. **Expo EAS Build:** Configure and build your React Native app using Expo EAS.
    3. **Expo EAS Deployment:** Deploy your React Native app to Expo's hosting or prepare for app store submission.
    4. **End-to-End Testing:** Perform end-to-end testing of the entire app, from dream submission to interpretation display.
    5. **Bug Fixes:** Address any critical bugs found during testing.
    6. **Documentation:** Write basic documentation for your API endpoints and any key aspects of your code.
